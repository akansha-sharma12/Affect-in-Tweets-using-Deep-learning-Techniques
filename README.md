Affects In Tweets
This project aims to analyze Tweeter data using Deep Learning, machine learning techniques.

There are three task as-:
1. Emotion Intensity Regression  
2. Emotion oridinal classification 
3. Emotion multilabel classes


Prerequisites:

numpy
pandas
keras
matplotlibi
h5fs
tensorflow
glob
A 6.0 Gb GPU is required for a fast training.
 Emotion Intensity Regression  - open Task 1 file with four different emotions(fear,joy,sadness,angry) by machine learning techniques with given datasets.
 Emotion Ordinal classification - open Task 2 Jupyter notebook code with four differnet emotions by deep learning and machine learning techniques both having dataset infered as-;
 The prediction is a classification between 0 and 3.
0: no emotion infered
1: low emotion infered
2: middle emotion infered
3: high emotion infered
Emotion classification - open Task 5 with eleven different emotions by deep learning techniques
